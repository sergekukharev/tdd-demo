# TDD Demo

A repo I'm using to demonstrate TDD technique.

My goal is to teach following TDD concepts:

* 3 rules of TDD
* Red-Green-Refactor 
* The Single Assert Rule
* Arrange, Act, Assert Rule
* Principle: "As tests get more specific, code gets more generic"

## 3 rules of TDD

1. You can’t write any production code until you have first written a failing 
   unit test.
2. You can’t write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not 
   compiling is failing.
3. You can’t write more production code than is sufficient to pass the 
   currently failing unit test.

## Katas

Apart of 3 simple katas presented in this repo, there is a whole world of 
katas out there.
